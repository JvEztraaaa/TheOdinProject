    <h2>What is TheOdinProject?</h2>
    <p><strong><em>The Odin Project</em></strong> is a free, open-source community for full-stack web development training. The bootcamp prepares individuals with no technical experience to become web developers while collaborating with other learners.</p>

    <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
    <p>It's structured to guide beginners through fundamental programming concepts and more advanced topics, all while helping students build their own projects and portfolio.</p>
    
    <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>The Odin Project was created by <strong>Erik Trautman</strong> in 2013 as part of his work with the Viking Code School, an online bootcamp. It was developed to make high-quality coding education accessible to anyone interested in web development, regardless of financial barriers. Initially a side project, it quickly gained popularity due to its structured, open-source curriculum and project-based learning style.</p>
